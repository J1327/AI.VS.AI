(..) Civilization 5 Modification , which removes annoying things ..<br>
<br>
IF YOU HAVE SLOW SPEED NETWORK PLEASE BACK UP GAME <i style="color:Red!important;">"JUST IN CASE(TM)"</i>
<br><br>
EACH MOD UPLOAD/RE-UPLOAD REQUIRES RESTART THE GAME TO HAVE EVERYTHING LOADED UP ..
<br><br>
WHY *&^? DIPLOMACY:<br>
* Ticking this ------ > [X] DIPLOMACY in setup , later on in the middle of the game you won't be able to press button "next turn"  (even in the settings are ticked SP/MP End turn automatically) because you are forced to vote there and this mod changes congress by trying to skip it..<br>
 so..<br>
* marking this override --- > "disable world congress" obviously disables this victory type and solves the problem.. <br>
* By the way as default you can't activate this.. so you need manually* edit settings file to enable this hidden feature..<br>
* Enable Hidden options will be attached..<br>
<br><br>
note: Theoracly diplomacy is still in tact and working but only in setup page [TEAM1] [TEAM2] ..
<br><br>
there's pretty HIGH risk of crashing game if you completely remove these files..<br>
<b>there's NO workaround mod for these file replacement's (at least known to me..)</b>
<br><br>
MOD COMPABILITY:<br>
<strike>DISABLING TOOLTIPS can brake IGE since its using tooltips as its engine..<br>
so for this time , then solution will be found 4 tooltips -- enable/disable won't be released yet for tooltips..</strike><br>
<br><br>
For now no complains with mods combability..<br>
<br><br>
MISC:<br>
Debugging settings (in Documents) will be attached..<br>
